# Snake
This program is a reproduction of the snake game to run in a terminal window.

## State
The game is completed, with no menu, and I do not intend to add it.

## Controls
WASD for movement, escape for exit.

## Running
(for linux) In order to run this program, you have to compile it with the fpc compiler (`fpc game.pas`), and run the generated executable file.
