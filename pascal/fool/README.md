# Fool
This is a basic terminal implementation of the card game "fool" with a 36 card deck. You can play 1 on 1 against a dumb ai,
I might add smarter versions in the future.

### Running
(for linux) In order to run this program, you have to compile it with the fpc compiler with the "find units" flag:
fpc -Fu"./*" main.pas, and run the generated executable file.
