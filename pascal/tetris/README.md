# Tetris
This program is a reproduction of tetris to run in a terminal window. Minimum window size to run the game is 32 by 32 symbols.

## State
The game is completed, with no menu, and I do not intend to add it.

## Controls
WASD for movement, space for rotation, escape for exit.

## Running
(for linux) In order to run this program, you have to compile it with the fpc compiler (`fpc tetris.pas`), and run the generated executable file.
