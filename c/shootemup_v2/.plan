    * Add term colors initialization
    * Choose colors for objects
    * Set up color pairs (init functions in modules, run in init_game)
    * Add color switching to show funcs

Boss fight:
* Add boss shape, movement, spawn, point-in, bullets
* Impl basics and test with keyboard input
* Add gunshots (shooting, delay, emitters, updating)
* Add mines (spawn grid, explode (temp: kill) in some time)
* Impl explosion effect and it's collision checking
* Add boss hp and collisions with player and pbullets
* Add boss hp ui
* Insert into game flow (after asteroid phase)
* Add win screen ui
* Restore debug control keys for boss weapons
* Add player-to-boss bullet collisions
* Add immediate expl on touching mine
* Add gunshot explosions and trigger near player
    * Add calculation of distance to player center
    * Add explosion params (trigger dist, radius) to gunshots
    * Add explosion spawning in collisions.c module
* Add explosion-to-player-collisions 
    * To note: deactivate damaging ability of expl when hit player, but leave
        the visuals
* Add boss force field spec move (big blue explosion with boss in center)
- Impl boss behaviour:
    * Create a module for boss AI interfacing with boss.h
    * Write out the set of moves the boss can perform
    - Implement primitive moves:
        * Fly from a to b (vert or horiz) with speed X
        * Teleport to position
        - Fire bullets for time X
        - Fire gunshots N times with delay X
        - Plant mines and wait until exploded
        - Fire force field
    - Implement main moves:
        - Move to the side and then move 3/4 of screen with constant bullet fire
        - Move side to side following player with gunshots and bullet bursts
        - 3 times port to player x coord and ram
        - Port to center up/center/down and plant mines
        - At 50%hp: fire force field 3 times
    - Create a primitive random choice of next move

Addition ideas:
- Impl adaptive drawing on screen edge (draw part of shape) and make riods, 
    boss and crates come out and go out gradually
- Add buttons for "move&fire" (or learn to get multiple key pressed)
- Add progressive hardening of the asteroid phase with score (decr spawn delay,
    decr probability of rep kits, inc ast speed)
- I may be able to lighten some data structures by creating more constants or
    static datas for things like damage and so on.
- Implement blink and explosion on boss death

To remember:
* Some effects (namely, explosions to boss) may draw over player/boss ships,
    when the ships are stationary. I should make shure to redraw them if they
    haven't moved.

Bugs:
* After exiting from game over menu got a frame of old game state
    Random signals of some unknown buttons were outrunning the escape signal,
    so the game went into restart and then terminated due to esc in main 
    cycle, so i restricted the resart button to R, and the problem was gone
* Sometimes the game starts and nothing spawns
    Solution: I did not reset the spawn timer, so sometimes it would get inited
    with big "current time"
* Before collisions empty parts of shapes are drawn over others
    Possible solution: remake drawing to char-by-char and not drawing spaces
* After explosion a trail is left with the ui attr
* On the player's right side and the bosses right side (left for the player)
    the bullets seem to dissapear before the rectangle
* Because I switch player bullet color pair on draw, sometimes bullets
    alternate colors. I should assign a color pair index to bullets.
