*init protocol step: confirmation
    * Client check & response
    * Server check and fsm advance

*Login:
    * Create unified message type (prefix, diff for serv&client
        +content, unified separators)
    * Make unified message checking (first check header, then parse content)
        * Impl in client, check init msg
        * Insert into sess
    * Send login&passwd to server
    * Parse and match with file server side

*Protocol remake:
    * Impl a netstring full msg
    * Fix problem: currently delimiter : still can not be inside a word
        * Remake message packing
        * Remake message parsing
    * Idea: make string lengths ints (not decimal strings), since there is max

File list:
    * Make client dialogue with options (as of now -- simple)
    * Make client action & protocol request
    * Make server response
    * Parse out database and add names to the response
    - On parsing dirent check files (& load meta into memory?)
    - Pack filenames & descritions, and send them out

File query:
    - Make protocol request
    - Recieve serverside
    - Lookup file and check metafile access
    - If not good, send reply (no file/no access)

File transfer:
    - Test single write (need to pre-send total file size)
    - Implement cutting up

Login remake:
    - Make login one of the actions & optional
    - Remake server as not to expect login and add privilege to session info
    - Update file list as to only display avalilable files

Other:
    - Make title a bbs property & send with init msg
    - Random refac
    - Add file status to metafile (valid, writing, corrupted), for disconnections when loading file
    - Make client disconnection detection (client now sending requests into the blue)
        - Idea: send session end message?
        - Idea: check for EOF in read res
    - Make adequate client exiting
    - Idea: make timeouts for pending requests?
